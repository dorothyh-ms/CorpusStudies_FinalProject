I asked him which of the 53 new schemes that the Government are introducing into their national road programme this year 	19910708a754_3.txt

They would be delayed, if not cancelled, were the Labour party to take control.	19920309a629_9.txt

95	  hope, therefore, to the rest of us. New clause 29 allows the IBA to sell transmission equipment at less than market value to radio companies as part of the arrangements for the transition to the new radio regime. 	It is part of the cushioning process that most hon. Members seek. Amendment No. 482 would ensure that any equipment disposed of in that way was not caught by the scheme for the division of the IBA's three 	19900508a58_3.txt

I am sorry that I am not in a position to resolve those matters conclusively this afternoon, but there is a strong case for transitional arrangements in the Bill. 	It is their shape that is still the subject of further discussion.	19900508a67_0.txt
97	 The hon. Gentleman is being less than fair because 	it is absolutely clear that there has to be a networking arrangement; it is far less than clear whether or not it should be the ITC's duty to determine that and be the programme scheduler for the 	19900508a70_1.txt
98	  emergence of a good, competitive Channel 3 or whether it would inhibit it. That is a question on which people equally committed to making the new system work and assisting potential franchise applicants may well agree to differ. 	It is quite clear in the Bill that the ITC will be able to send out a formidable set of guidelines to would-be applicants who, if they fail to bring themselves within the guidelines, would be in 	19900508a70_1.txt
99	 I am most grateful to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) for curtailing his remarks to allow me to say my piece. 	It is appropriate that we should put in a statutory arrangement for an equal opportunities policy. I envisage that the ITC will be placed under a duty to attach conditions to the relevant licences, requiring the licensees to 	19900508a93_2.txt
100	  moratorium; that point is not lost on me. However, the other side of the case should not go by default, and I shall briefly outline it. The ITV network has in the past been protected from takeovers. 	It is not clear whether that has been of benefit to ITV or whether some of the complacent and inward-looking characteristics of the system — for in — stance, its inability until recent times to come to terms with 	19900508a109_0.txt
101	  felt there were any attractions in a moratorium, with respect to the House, I do not imagine that they would want to go further than the period suggested by the IBA, which was 12 months. To be frank, 	it is higly questionable whether they would want to go that far. The whole issue turns on an evalution of some of the key points. Hon. Members have expressed the fear that the consequence of allowing takeovers would 	19900508a109_0.txt
102	  with an appropriate general policy of leaving such decisions to the ITC's discretion. In enabling the Commission itself to conduct research, the new clause raises issues that we discussed at length in Committee. We believe that 	it is better that research should be Commissioned rather than done in-house, although I accept that that is not a central point. The trouble with new clause 27 is that it blurs the areas of responsibility for the 	19900508a148_4.txt
103	  am sure that the hon. Gentleman's arguments will sound even more exciting when they are made in the debate that we are due to have, and which no one can avoid, on the subject of whether 	it is right that there should be cross-media ownership restrictions on Sky Television and others. The hon. Gentleman's remarks would be relevant to the amendment only if Sky continued to broadcast without a licence. He is 	19900508a151_0.txt
104	  to prosecution. With respect to the hon. Member, I think that that is a sufficient deterrent. The point about clauses 165 and 166 is that this apparatus is not available in the case of services originating outside the jurisdiction. 	It is for those services that they are needed. In the light of that, and knowing that the hon. Gentleman has just been warming up his tonsils for his assault on the substantive issue of satellite cross-media 	19900508a153_4.txt
105	  expect that there should be an independent body charged by the House with responsibility for competition policy, monitoring the way in which these arrangements are carried through. It is no disrespect to the BBC, any more than 	it is disrespect to Ministers that we can be made subject to Parliament, to Select Committees or to the judiciary. It is part and parcel of the checks and balances in a sophisiticated society. We went over the 	19900509a359_5.txt
106	  mean by that later. The hon. Gentleman's first point concerned the word "persistently". I am sure that I will have the support of all hon. Members who have studied the matter when I say categorically that 	it is the requirement for persistence that has prevented the Sexual Offences Act 1985 from being effectively enforced against people who have plainly committed acts of kerb-crawling solicitation from cars. The element of persistence has made it difficult 	19900511a543_0.txt
107	 Yes it was, but pursuant, as I recall, to one of these rather frantic Friday discussions during which 	it was not possible to include that word, but we undertook as a condition of allowing the Bill to proceed, that it would be introduced in another place. I am not remotely embarrassed by this discussion. My only 	19900511a546_1.txt

Lady will agree that 	it was about time that a Government came to power who were willing to put resources into the prisons, and this Government are doing that.	19900614a451_5.txt
109	  he suppose that so many of his constituents thought it perfectly proper to shop on a Sunday? Does he really think that, whatever the law and its enforcement may be, which is not a matter for me, 	it is a sustainable basis on which to take British law into the last decade of the 20th century that we should have criminal penalties for people who simply want to sell legitimate household items to other members 	19900614a455_1.txt
110	 The sad fact is that the schedule to the Act contains a list of prohibited items that do not reflect the stock held by any shop. Therefore, 	it is almost impossible to think of any shop that is open on a Sunday and is trading lawfully. That is why I repeat that it is difficult not to sympathise with those who are trying to struggle 	19900614a456_4.txt
111	  time when the prison service is striving to cope with the aftermath of Strangeways and when we have announced a major refurbishment of that prison, as well as seeking to honour our commitments to upgrade other prisons, 	it is dreadful that as a result of industrial action we are having to pay the police service £180 per night to accommodate prisoners when there is plenty of room in the prisons in the north to accommodate prisoners 	19900614a461_6.txt
112	 I am playing the hon. Gentleman's game, but even he is coming to the end of it. We might as well at least hear something on the other side of the case. 	It is a recognised fact that private Members bring forward legislation with Government support and effect major changes in the criminal law, as was done to increase the sentences for drug trafficking to life imprisonment. That is a 	19900706a1295_0.txt

Gentleman has an opportunity to ensure that the predicted consequences of the Bill the last time objection was made to it, five years ago, are erased. 	It is unfortunate that the hon. Gentleman will not even accept the guidance of his Front Bench but stands apart from every other Member who has participated in the debate, whatever ghostly comments he may have heard in 	19900706a1295_0.txt
114	 . I do not propose to carry on making the hon. Gentleman's task of filibustering any easier. The fact that I do not rise to my feet does not mean that I accept any of his points. 	It is utterly wrong that someone who commits rape should get away with it on a technicality. The idea that such a person can be charged with other offences — as he can — does not go to the point. 	19900706a1296_0.txt
115	 Three-year funding is an important development, because it allows people to know where they stand. 	It is also dependent on estimates of future changes which sometimes require fine tuning. I hope that we may see evidence of fine tuning shortly.	19901029a720_3.txt
116	  made it clear that the Government have nothing to be ashamed of in regard to the level of state funding. I have made to the Treasury the case for increases, with what effect will soon be revealed. 	It is also the case that a successful theatre, like any successful arts organisation, must look to others for assistance and must run its affairs properly. State funding is only one part of that.

118	  settlement merely follows on from his tremendous efforts during his five years as Minister for the Arts, culminating in last year's settlement. The aim of the enhancement fund is to enhance the activities of excellent companies. 	It is not confined to companies that have run up deficits.	19901126a612_7.txt
119	  of money for particular uses. For instance, there was an incentive fund of £5 million and my right hon. Friend made provision for an additional £3 million this year for different sorts of incentive schemes. Because of present needs, 	it is right that there should be an enhancement fund, but I do not propose to enter into the details of its distribution. If, however, I obtain money from the Treasury on the basis that there are needs 	19901126a613_0.txt
120	 I think that the hon. Lady's problem is more fundamental. She seems to think that the only way to assist manufacturers is to spend Government money on them, when 	it is the framework in which manufacturing industry has to operate which is the key. It was the improvement in that framework which led to massive increases in productivity and manufacturing output in the 1980s, and the same 	19901206a437_0.txt

She seems to think that the only way to assist manufacturers is to spend Government money on them, when it is the framework in which manufacturing industry has to operate which is the key. 	It was the improvement in that framework which led to massive increases in productivity and manufacturing output in the 1980s, and the same improvement will ensure that manufacturing comes through the present difficult period and goes on to 	19901206a437_0.txt
122	  that about £700 million has been made available for rail and underground improvements to benefit major parts of London's network. I will ensure that his views on the Northern line are passed on to London Regional Transport. 	It is a great myth that there is under-investment, as British Rail and London Underground will be spending about £750 million in the next three years on safety alone. That shows just how much investment is going into 	19901206a437_2.txt
123	 I am aware that there are those who hold that view — I think that quite a lot of other people hold a contrary view. 	It is by no means demonstrable that a more independent bank would enable the British economy to function more effectively. For instance, the Bank of Japan is one of the least independent banks in the world.	19901206a444_2.txt

The debate has provided us with the opportunity to consider the Government's plans and to have another 	19910213a938_0.txt
125	 	It is certainly true that there was a fall in the savings ratio, but we must consider the rates of inflation that prevailed in those two years. The savings ratio for first three quarters of 1990 was back to 8·8 	19910228a1100_5.txt

It shows that, at constant 1985 prices, comparing like with like —   — 	19910515a291_2.txt
127	  the hon. Gentleman wants to take issue with me on the health service. In 1977–78 Labour cut real spending on the NHS by 2·5 per cent. It is true that, during their period in office, real spending increased, but 	it was at less than half the rate that we have managed, and they cut real capital spending by no less than 16 per cent. One does not have to travel too far in this country to see evidence 	19910515a293_6.txt
128	  between the Government plans that we are debating today — carefully prioritised, sustainable and targeted where spending is needed most — and the cloud-cuckoo-land ambitions and total incoherence of the Opposition's plans is striking and dramatic. 	It is on that basis that I commend these reports to the House.	19910515a299_2.txt
129	 	It is true that manufacturing export performance is important in this country. That is why, despite the Labour party's perennial endeavour to talk down British industry and important parts of it, it is worth while saluting our 	19910516a410_7.txt

The Labour party is not trusted on tax matters, and that is small wonder when its Members of Parliament say 	19920122a406_3.txt
151	  workers, teachers and the low-paid with a different tune. By harping on 'Tory underfunding', they deliberately create the impression that a Labour Government would spend far more. Yet unless taxes were raised substantially, it could not. 	It is absolutely clear that many Labour Members want taxes to be raised but are not prepared to say so. They want taxes raised that have an impact on ordinary people. Labour Members say that they want to 	19920122a406_7.txt

Another reason why the country needs to be saved from a Labour Government is that 	it is bad enough to have the type of nonsense that went on in Luigi's restaurant happening when the Labour party is in opposition, but it would be especially ridiculous if it happened with the Labour party 	19920122a407_6.txt

It is the first dinner that he has ever attended where he opened his mouth only to eat.	19920219a421_3.txt

He had to admit that 	it is about to produce a document which sets out its spending plans and the tax implications of those. So the Labour party will not produce a document just yet.	19920219a426_3.txt
158	 I note that the hon. Gentleman has been joined by the public school tendency. 	It is a pernicious combination that is beginning to make me fearful. What would an economic debate be without an intervention from the hon. Gentleman? It is Don Quixote without Sancho Panza.	19920226a974_2.txt

The following day, inflation fell from 4·5 per cent. to 4·1 per cent. 	It is astonishing that the hon.

Is it not 	19920226a976_2.txt
161	  that is the case. I trust that the use of photocopying facilities in the House by the Labour party is equally subject to his scrutiny, given that he is so censorious. Let us come to the point. 	It is beyond denial that the most fundamentally important factor for the success of British industry is low inflation; yet, in his party conference speeches between 1983 and 1988, the Leader of the Opposition did not mention the word "inflation" 	19920226a976_5.txt
162	  the nation's problems rather than the sine qua non of resolving them. It has opposed every measure that has brought inflation down, and it shows genuine resentment at the success of our policy to do so. 	It is apparent that the Leader of the Opposition was only too happy, in his days as a wild opponent of what the Government were doing, to stoke up rather than reverse the inflation of the 1970s.

Happily, we will hear the Opposition's view in due course, but 	it is already clear that under the last Labour Government the PSBR was higher on average than it has ever been under this Government, and it only temporarily fell to 3½ per cent. in 1977–78 following International Monetary Fund intervention. 	19920313a1134_5.txt

Friend's supplementary question, I agree that local authorities should make strenuous efforts to keep their expenditure down. 	It is reported that some have nevertheless suggested a figure of £370 or more for community charge. If we had retained domestic rates instead of the present community charge, that would have led to an increase in domestic rates 	19900220a774_6.txt
202	 Bearing in mind that the community charge in Scotland meets only 14 per cent. of the expenditure of local authorities, and that Scotland's earnings are about the fourth highest in the United Kingdom, I believe 	it is not that people cannot pay their community charge; it may be that some have been led not to pay it on wrong advice of others.	19900220a778_5.txt

217	 The matter of cost will be discussed with the Home Secretary.

219	  the hon. Gentleman says or his interpretation of it. Civil servants in my private office have served Governments of both political complexions with great efficiency, conscientiousness and professionalism. That is a great strength of our system, and 	it is understood that we do not normally attack people in this House where they cannot answer back.

There is nothing specifically European about a federal structure — indeed, the opposite: 	it is the nation state which is European.

Instead of pouring distinctive nations into institutions 	19910626a1028_1.txt

Although I understand that this EC regulation, when it comes into force on 21 September, is the definitive instrument, even in British domestic law, 	it is a consequential statutory instrument which adjusts various provisions and may be helpful.

The note could have gone on to say, for the avoidance of doubt and in view of the time scale to which the Minister referred, that 	it was advantageous to have an additional piece of paper which changed British law in certain respects, and those changes could then have been described. Perhaps even now, as what is before the House is but a draft, 	19900724a425_2.txt

We can all work that one out. 	It is alleged that there has been a 100 per cent. increase in CO2 over the past 100 years. However, many of the measurements 100 years ago were extremely susceptible to error. The actual increase has been from three parts in 1 	19911108a713_2.txt

527	 I congratulate the Government on their remarkable turnround of our economy from the strike-ridden, dilapidated, collapsing structure in 1979, when we came in, to the dynamic and modern economy that we have today. 	It is unfortunate that there are people who are out of work, but we should try to keep a balance and remember that most people who want work are in work.

Nevertheless, there are still many opportunities for people here.	19911129a1200_0.txt
